# To-Do-List

Add in tasks you need to complete!


I've created a 'to-do list'for my first proper mini project, coded in JavaScript, HTML and CSS. 

A great mini project for me to learn some more fundementals of JavaScript, commenting out bits of the code to see which parts change the running of the app 
i.e 'if this block of code doesn't have this part, what will happen?

The method below, stopping the browser from automatically refreshing I found very interesting
to see how it works!

//e.preventDefault()//
